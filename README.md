# MONITORING-AUTONOMOUS-SYSTEM-NETWORK
In a network, an articulation point is a node whose removal disconnects the network. Many real-world networks are connected by these nodes, ranging from infrastructure networks to protein interaction networks and terrorist communication networks. Despite their fundamental importance, a general framework for studying articulation points in complex networks is lacking. Analytical tools are developed to analyze articulation points, such as the expected number of them and the vulnerability of the network to their removal, in arbitrary complex networks. The greedy process of removing articulation points provides us with a different understanding of the organizational principles of complex networks. Moreover, this process is associated with two fundamentally different types of percolation transitions. In our study, we shed light on the development of more resilient infrastructure networks and the effective destruction of terrorist communication networks.
